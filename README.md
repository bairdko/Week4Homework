#  Crystal Collector
###### Assigned: 6/30/18
This homework was the fourth homework, and our first introduction to jQuery to handle events and DOM interactions. Previously, we had just been using plain Javascript.

#### Game Mechanics
- **Add the crystals together to hit the target number.**
- Upon load, each crystal is assigned a random number value.
- When the player clicks a crystal, it adds its value to the total score, but the value is hidden from the player initially.
- Realistically, the player can very easily figure out the number assigned to each crystal, as long as they know basic math.
- Add the crystals' hidden values together to reach the exact target. 
- If you go over the target, you lose.

**Known issues:** There are no known issues

**Potential Improvements:** This game could be made a lot more of an actual game if the crystals' values were regenerated each time a player clicked on one. It would make it more of a game of luck instead of simple arithmetic.
